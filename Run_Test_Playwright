Step 1:
    - cd Hotel_Management_Website/frontend
    - npm install
    - npm i -D @playwright/test
    - npx playwright install
Step 2: 
    - Run the tests (mock mode, default)
        $env:HEADED="1" npx playwright test -c playwright/playwright.config.ts --project=chromium
    - Run headed for debugging
        $env:USE_MOCKS="0" npx playwright test -c playwright/playwright.config.ts
    - Run both (headed + real backend)
        $env:HEADED="1" $env:USE_MOCKS="0" npx playwright test -c playwright/playwright.config.ts --project=chromium
    - Reset back to default (recommended after testing)
        Remove-Item Env:HEADED -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        Remove-Item Env:USE_MOCKS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Step 3: 
    - Run exactly one test according to the test case name.
        npx playwright test -c playwright/playwright.config.ts --list
    - Run a "Cart empty state" test in Chromium.
        npx playwright test -c playwright/playwright.config.ts --project=chromium -g "Cart empty state"
